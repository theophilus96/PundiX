First release of dependency libraries, command-line tools, initial extension with design and Testnet focused integration.\n2. Release version for Chrome, Firefox (and more) with Testnet focused integration (mainly on FX blockchain). Creation of Nammy node validator.\n3. Release for supported web-browser focusing on FX and ETH blockchains (and more), most likely with initial Dapps integration. Hopefully Mainnet ready (expected over 50 unique users).\n4. First releases (on corresponding web-browser stores) integrated with Mainnet (and Testnet) and Dapps integration. Adding supporting docs. Expected over 200 unique users.\n5. Releases focusing on Dapps with new smart contracts, improved security and easy to use. Documenting usage. Expected over 400 unique installs.\n6. Releases with expanded support for cross-browser compatibility, different blockchains, Dapps and blockchain explorer, and community-driven features. Expected over 500-1000 unique installs.\n\n- Project repository: https://github.com/Nammy-fx\n- Site: https://nammy-fx.github.io/ which is going to be used for releases and downloads (under construction)\n- More details and comments: https://forum.functionx.io/t/a-web-browser-based-fx-wallet-not-a-metamask/1193",

Members can draw funds directly from this pot which have (intended) passed governance voting instead of a needing to submit to the Ecosystem Genesis Fund. This allows more effective fund allocations. Funds from f(x)DM marketing needs to be approved by four of seven committee members (four from outside of the foundation).

                "description": "Summary: This proposal aims to improve FX liquidity on centralized exchanges. Market makers provide buy/sell orders on either side of the midpoint, allowing users on exchanges to buy, sell, and trade the token more efficiently, giving greater confidence in the asset. In order to provide ample liquidity, Kronos Research is requesting a loan of 6,800,000 FX tokens for a period of 1 year. With this loan, Kronos Research can provide liquidity on Coinbase (FX/USD), Bithumb (FX/KRW), KuCoin (FX/BTC) and Upbit (FX/BTC). Currently the liquidity on these platforms is inconsistent, and we expect, as the terms of this proposal, to increase it by 50%-100% with stable uptimes.\n\nNote: Kronos Research does not attempt to influence market price in either direction.\n\nKronos Background:\nKronos Research is a proprietary trading firm founded in 2018 that trades on average more than $5b USD per day across global platforms. In DeFi, Kronos Research is a leading designated market-maker on platforms like dYdX, Matcha, and ParaSwap. Kronos Research also incubated and is the sole market maker on WOO Network and WOO X.\n\nAction items:\nVote YES for: Accept the proposal\nVote NO for: Reject the proposal",

**GET    /totalWithdrawnAmount**

To query all coins in the community pool which is under Governance control

## FAQ

**Qn: Do we need to git clone the repo before running the Get request?**

A: Nope, you don't have to download the entire repo. You only have to download the Final folder and run Main.go file. That would help start up the HTTP server to which you can send requests.

From the command line in the directory containing main.go, run the code. Use a dot argument to mean ârun code in the current directory.â

```
$ go run .
```


**Qn: Should we be replacing the localhost with a known validator IP address?**

A: The validator IP address has already been configured on the backend of the code. Hence, by running the queries such as:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/communitypool
```
We will still be able to retrieve the same results.


## Commonly encountered problems

Do also note that I am using Go 1.18. It is known to cause some errors on Macs. This was caused by an old version of golang.org/x/sys
```
go get -u golang.org/x/sys
```
Running the code above would help solve the issue.
